         - HTTP: `curl` (dump ALL response headers with -i/-D-, follow/inspect redirects, set methods/params/cookies), `wget`.\n\
         - Ports/services: `rustscan` if present, else `nmap`; if neither is installed you may \
           install via apt (`apt install -y nmap`), brew, or cargo (`cargo install rustscan`) — \
           otherwise probe common ports with `curl`/`nc`.\n\
         - Content/params/URLs: `ffuf`, `gobuster`, `gau`, `katana`, `waybackurls`, `linkfinder` when available.\n\
         - JS ANALYSIS: download every linked script (`curl -s <script.js>`) and grep it for endpoints/paths, \
           `fetch(`/`axios`/XHR URLs, API & GraphQL routes, hidden params, and secrets (AKIA…, `api_key`, `token`, \
           `Bearer `, `authorization`), plus `sourceMappingURL` (fetch the .map to recover original source). \
           Prefer `linkfinder`/`gau`/`katana` to harvest more URLs when present, else regex with `grep -Eo`.\n\
         - REQUEST/RESPONSE ANALYSIS: read status codes, every header, Set-Cookie flags, content-type, body length \
           and response timing; use DIFFERENTIALS (authenticated vs anonymous, valid vs invalid input, existing vs \
           missing resource) and reflected input / verbose errors to infer behavior and CONFIRM issues with evidence. \
           Save full request/response pairs when they matter for the PoC.\n\
         - NUCLEI (fast, targeted — never a blind full scan): first fingerprint the stack, then run nuclei ONLY on \
           relevant templates, e.g. `nuclei -u <target> -tags <detected-tech,cve> -severity critical,high,medium \
           -rl 50 -timeout 8 -retries 1` (or `-t <specific-template>` for a suspected CVE). Prefer targeted \
           `-id`/`-tags` over the whole template set so it stays quick; confirm any hit manually with curl.\n\
         - MISCONFIG HUNTING: probe for absurd-but-common misconfigurations — exposed `.git`/`.env`/backup & config \
           files, directory listing, debug/actuator/trace endpoints, default & weak credentials, open admin panels, \
           permissive CORS, verbose stack traces, exposed dashboards (Kibana/Grafana/Jenkins/phpMyAdmin), and cloud \
           metadata (169.254.169.254) via SSRF.\n\
         - RATE-LIMIT / ANTI-AUTOMATION: on auth, password-reset, OTP and sensitive endpoints, send a controlled \
           burst (e.g. ~20-30 requests) and check for 429/lockout/Retry-After/backoff; report absence as a finding. \
           Keep bursts small and non-disruptive — this is a control check, not a DoS.\n\
         - TOOL DOWNLOAD (authorized): when a public PoC or scanner is needed you MAY `git clone` a specific PoC/exploit \
           repo or download a tool (`git clone`, `wget`, `pip install`, `go install`, `cargo install`) — use pinned, \
           reputable sources; review before running; never run destructive payloads. ALWAYS time-box downloads/installs \
           (`timeout 90 <install> || echo skip`) and try each at most once — if it fails, isn't packaged, has no network \
           or hangs, SKIP it and fall back to curl/nc/dig/python3. A missing or un-downloadable tool is NEVER a reason \
           to stall: move on with what you have.\n\
         - PICK THE BEST TOOL, DON'T SETTLE FOR THIS LIST: the tools above are a starting menu, not a limit.            You are expected to reason about the CONTEXT and reach for (or install) the strongest tool for THAT job,            the way a real operator does — if a better/more specific tool exists, research it, provision it (see TOOL            DOWNLOAD), and use it. Prefer battle-tested tooling over hand-rolled scripts when it fits.
         - CONTEXT TOOLBOXES (provision what the detected surface calls for; time-box each install, skip on failure):
           · Active Directory / Windows / SMB / LDAP / Kerberos: `netexec`(nxc)/`crackmapexec`, the `impacket` suite              (secretsdump, GetUserSPNs, GetNPUsers, ntlmrelayx, psexec/wmiexec/smbexec), `bloodhound-python`/`bloodhound-ce`              + neo4j for the AD graph, `kerbrute`, `certipy` (AD CS/ESC), `ldapdomaindump`, `enum4linux-ng`, `responder`,              `evil-winrm`, `Coercer`/`PetitPotam`, `adidnsdump`. Map credential→identity→permission→machine and feed the              internal attack graph.
           · Web / API deep recon: `httpx`, `katana`, `gau`, `waybackurls`, `subfinder`/`amass` (only in-scope),              `arjun` (param mining), `nuclei` (targeted), `feroxbuster`/`ffuf`, `jwt_tool`, `graphw00f`/`clairvoyance`              (GraphQL), `trufflehog`/`gitleaks` on exposed repos.
           · Cloud: `pacu`, `scoutsuite`, `prowler`, `trivy`, the provider CLIs (`aws`/`gcloud`/`az`), `cloud_enum`.
           · Exploitation frameworks: `metasploit`/`msfconsole` and `msfvenom` for payloads/PoCs, `sqlmap` for deep SQLi,              `commix` for command injection — use surgically, non-destructively, never a blind auto-exploit.
           · Secrets/creds & cracking (offline, on captured material only): `hashcat`/`john`, `trufflehog`.
           · Mobile (APK/IPA): `mobsf` (run HEADLESS via its Docker image / REST API, not the GUI), `apktool`, `jadx`, \
             `apkleaks`, `objection`/`frida`; `nuclei` on discovered endpoints.\n\
           · Reverse engineering / binaries: `ghidra` HEADLESS (`analyzeHeadless`), `radare2`/`rizin`, `binwalk`, \
             `checksec`, `gdb`; decompile and triage without any GUI.\n\
           · Any GUI tool runs HEADLESS: prefer a CLI / REST / `analyzeHeadless` / `--no-gui` mode or the Docker \
             image; never require an X display. If a tool is GUI-only, drive its API or skip it.\n\
         - HEAVY TOOLBOX: many of these ship in `kali-linux-large` or install via apt/pipx/go — when running in the Kali            sandbox they are one `apt install`/`pipx install` away; provision on demand for the context at hand.
         - CVE -> PoC SOURCING (core capability, not a last resort): the moment you fingerprint a concrete version            (WordPress core/plugin/theme, a CMS, framework/library, an OS package, a service banner), find and run a real            proof-of-concept for its known CVEs:
           · `searchsploit <product> <version>` (Exploit-DB, offline in Kali); `searchsploit -m <id>` copies a PoC              locally, `-x` reads it, `-u` updates the DB.
           · Search Exploit-DB, GitHub (`github.com/search?q=CVE-XXXX-YYYY`), PacketStorm, Vulners and the GHSA/NVD              advisory for a working PoC; `git clone` the specific repo (pinned) or fetch the single script.
           · WordPress: `wpscan --url <t> --enumerate vp,vt,u` to pin vulnerable plugins/themes, then pull the PoC.
           · BUILD when needed: compile C/Go/Rust PoCs (`gcc`/`make`/`go build`/`cargo build`) or install Python/Ruby              deps in the sandbox; READ the exploit first, adapt hardcoded targets/ports to THIS engagement, run it              non-destructively (benign marker/`id`/OOB callback as proof, never a destructive payload).
           · Vet everything: reputable source, pinned version, read before running, time-box each fetch/build; if no PoC              exists or it will not build, fall back to a manual attempt or report the version as a lead. This is how you              exploit CVEs that have a public PoC.

If you only observed it but never used it, report it as a LEAD (low confidence), not a confirmed finding.\n\
- Chain across steps: reuse any session/JWT/cookie/credential you obtain in one step against every other module; if one bug yields access, pivot it into IDOR/privesc/data-exfil and report the CHAIN, not isolated parts.\n\
- Decode & fingerprint → CVE: decode opaque tokens/paths (base64/JSON/marshal) and fingerprint the stack (server, framework, library/gem/plugin versions); map exact versions to known CVEs and attempt a safe, non-destructive PoC.\n\

/// the observed responses, map & connect routes, mine parameters, test both auth
/// levels, and build PoCs — instead of blindly firing a fixed payload list.
const DECISION_DOCTRINE: &str = "DECIDE WHERE TO ATTACK (analyse, then act):\n\
- Analyse responses FIRST: read status, headers, content-type, body, redirects and TIMING; let the evidence pick the technique (e.g. SQL error → SQLi; reflected input → XSS; numeric id in JSON → IDOR; missing X-Frame-Options → clickjacking; state-changing POST without a token → CSRF). Don't run payloads that the response makes irrelevant.\n\
- Map & CONNECT routes: build the route/endpoint graph and link one endpoint to another — an id/token/filename returned by endpoint A is the input to endpoint B; follow multi-step flows (login → profile → order → admin) and hunt the SENSITIVE ones (auth, password reset, payment, file upload/download, account/role changes, admin, export).\n\
- Mine PARAMETERS: enumerate query/body/header/cookie params (incl. hidden ones from JS/source maps); for each, reason about what it does and test the fitting attack (IDOR, injection, path traversal, mass-assignment, open-redirect, SSRF). Add plausible params the API might accept (id, user, role, admin, debug, redirect, file, callback).\n\
- MOCK realistic data: when a request needs valid-looking input to reach deeper logic, synthesize believable test data (emails, names, CPFs/SSNs with valid checksums, phone numbers, UUIDs, tokens, JSON bodies) so the flow proceeds — never use real PII.\n\
- Authenticated testing: if you can authenticate (given creds/roles or a login you performed), REUSE the session and exploit the AUTHENTICATED surface — the endpoints/params only reachable while logged in are where the high-impact bugs live. Test as EACH role you have (e.g. normal user AND admin) and compare.\n\
- Self-register when no creds are given: if the app allows sign-up, ANALYZE the register form (probe `form_details` has action/method/fields) and CREATE one clearly-marked benign test account (`nrsplt_<rand>@example.test`) — with curl (GET for CSRF+cookies, then POST the fields) or the Playwright browser for JS-rendered/multi-step forms — then log in and REUSE that session for authenticated testing. Register a second account only when a test needs two users. Non-destructive: one account, no mass-registration/spam; at signup also try mass-assignment (`role=admin`/`isAdmin`) and report it if accepted.\n\
- Build PoCs when needed: for issues that need an artifact to prove (clickjacking → an HTML page that frames the target; CSRF → an auto-submitting HTML form; a multi-step or timing exploit → a script), WRITE the PoC to the run's PoC dir, run/validate it, and cite the file in the evidence.\n\
- Test control BYPASSES: when something returns 401/403/redirect or is 'blocked', try to bypass it (verb tampering, path/case/encoding normalization, X-Original-URL / X-Rewrite-URL / X-Forwarded-* headers, missing-vs-invalid token, direct object/API access) and confirm the bypass with the two requests.\n\n";

/// harm data or state).
const CHAIN_DOCTRINE: &str = "CHAIN THE FOOTHOLD (pivot to deeper, provable impact — any primitive can chain):\n\
- Think in primitives, not labels: reduce the foothold to what it GIVES you (code exec, file read, file write, request forgery, a trusted identity, a leaked secret, arbitrary object access) and pick the next step from that.\n\
- Pivot playbook (attempt the fitting ones, prove each with a benign receipt):\n\
  · File upload / write → RCE: upload a webshell/handler to an executable path or poison a config/`.htaccess`/cron/serialized file; prove with a benign marker (`id`, unique echo, OOB DNS), not damage.\n\
  · SSRF → cloud/host takeover: hit `169.254.169.254` (IMDSv1/v2), GCP/Azure metadata, internal admin/actuator, `file://`/`gopher://`; loot temp creds/tokens and REUSE them.\n\
  · SQLi → RCE/LPE: stacked queries, `INTO OUTFILE`/`COPY … TO`, UDF, `xp_cmdshell`, read secrets/creds; then reuse creds to log in and escalate.\n\
  · LFI/path traversal → RCE: log/session/wrapper poisoning, `/proc/self/environ`, read source & secrets; combine with an upload for exec.\n\
  · XXE → SSRF/file read → creds; deserialization/SSTI → RCE via a gadget/template sink; prove exec with a marker.\n\
  · IDOR/BOLA/mass-assignment → account/tenant takeover or role escalation (`role=admin`); open-redirect/XSS/CORS → token/session theft → ATO.\n\
  · Exposed `.git`/backup/`.env`/secrets → reconstruct source & keys → auth to internal APIs, cloud, DB; default/leaked creds → domain/service compromise.\n\
  · A param that lands in a redirect/`Location` header → ALSO test CRLF/header injection on the SAME param (`%0d%0aX-Injected: pwned`, `%0d%0aSet-Cookie:`): an open redirect and response splitting share the sink, so never stop at the redirect.\n\
- Second-order & preconditions: a payload you STORE (profile/bio/name/review/filename) may only fire on a DIFFERENT page, often a privileged one (e.g. an admin search). Plant the payload, then TRIGGER it from every identity you hold; if the trigger page needs a role you lack, FIRST look for a privesc/IDOR/mass-assign to reach it, and if none exists, report the second-order as a CHAINED lead (payload stored + trigger located, blocked only by authorization) rather than dropping it.\n\
- Reuse loot relentlessly: every credential/JWT/cookie/API key/host you obtain is input to the next step — carry it forward across modules and try it everywhere it might be accepted.\n\
- Mine object references (this is the BOLA/IDOR engine): from EVERY response harvest each object identifier you see — numeric ids, UUIDs, order/invoice/document/ticket numbers, account/customer ids, filenames, emails, and any signed/opaque token — into a reference pool. Then systematically SUBSTITUTE another principal's identifier into every request that accepts one (path segment, query param, JSON field, header, cookie) and diff the response against your own: another user's data returned under your session IS the proof. Do this ACROSS identities — register/hold ≥2 accounts and cross them — and across endpoints, because an id leaked on one route (a list/search/export) is often the key to an object on another (a detail/update/delete route). Enumerate sequential ids sparingly (a small benign sample, never a mass scrape) to show the pattern, then stop at proof.\n\
- Understand the BUSINESS & LOGIC: reason about what the app is FOR (payments, orders, tenancy, KYC, entitlements) and chain toward business impact — payment/price/coupon abuse, cross-tenant data access, entitlement/limit bypass, workflow/state-machine skips (skip approval/verification steps), race conditions on balance/stock. These compound: each finding updates your model of the app for the next probe.\n\
- Stop at proof: demonstrate the impact with the SMALLEST safe step and report the CHAIN end-to-end; never destroy, overwrite, encrypt, mass-exfiltrate, or DoS to 'prove' it.\n\n";

- Trace, don't guess: follow tainted input from its SOURCE (request param, env, deserialization, file) to a dangerous SINK (SQL/exec/eval/template/path/SSRF/deserialize). Report only when source reaches sink without effective sanitization; note the path (`entry → … → sink`).\n\
- Version → CVE (static): read dependency manifests (package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, pom.xml, Gemfile.lock, Cargo.lock) and pin exact versions; map to known CVEs and cite the manifest line. Flag reachable, exploitable ones over merely-outdated ones.\n\
- Repro PoC (optional but valued): when a finding warrants it, WRITE a proof/repro script to $NEUROSPLOIT_POCS — e.g. the exact malicious input + the request/CLI call that would trigger the sink, or a unit-style harness exercising the vulnerable function — with a header comment (file:line it proves, how to run). Cite the PoC path in the evidence. Mark clearly that it demonstrates the code path (static-derived), not a live hit.\n\
- Calibrate: High/Critical only when the sink is reachable and exploitable from untrusted input; guarded/unreachable code is Low or a lead.\n\n";

/// Methodology directions for a modern JS SPA backed by a REST/GraphQL API
/// (Angular/React/Vue front + Node/Express-style API — the shape of OWASP Juice
/// Shop and many real apps). These are DIRECTIONS on HOW to hunt each vuln class,
/// NOT a challenge answer key: the agent still discovers, tests and PROVES each
/// issue against the live app. Injected only when recon shows a SPA/REST surface.
const SPA_API_DOCTRINE: &str = "SPA + REST/API METHODOLOGY (modern JS app — hunt the API, not just the shell):\n\
- MAP THE API FROM THE BUNDLE: curl the main JS bundle(s) (`main*.js`, `runtime*.js`, `vendor*.js`) and grep for route \
paths and API calls — client routes (Angular/React router table), `/rest/…`, `/api/…`, GraphQL, and any `http(s)://` / \
relative endpoints, param names, and hardcoded secrets/keys/emails. Build the real endpoint list from the code, then hit it.\n\
- HIDDEN CLIENT ROUTES: SPA pages are client-side and often unlinked — extract the router table from the bundle AND brute \
common ones (`#/administration`, `#/admin`, `#/accounting`, `#/score-board`, `#/wallet`, `#/deluxe-membership`); a route that \
renders admin/score/scoreboard content is a broken-access-control finding.\n\
- AUTH & SQLi: on the login endpoint try SQLi auth bypass (`' OR 1=1--`, `admin@…'--`, tautologies) in the email/username; on \
search/query params try error-based then UNION SELECT to exfil the schema and user table (email+password hash). Also test \
weak/default admin creds and account/email ENUMERATION (different response for existing vs unknown user).\n\
- JWT: decode any JWT; test alg:none / 'unsigned' acceptance, RS256→HS256 confusion using the server's public key as the HMAC \
secret, `kid`/`jku` injection, and whether the signature is verified at all — forge a token impersonating another/admin user.\n\
- IDOR / BOLA / mass-assignment: numeric or guessable ids on `/api/<Object>/:id` (baskets, orders, feedbacks, reviews, users) \
— change the id or the owner field to read/modify another user's data; at REGISTER/PATCH add unexpected fields (`role=admin`, \
`isAdmin`, `deletedAt`, `id`) and check if the server binds them (privilege escalation / resurrecting deleted accounts).\n\
- FILE ACCESS: file/download/ftp endpoints — path traversal (`../`), and POISON NULL BYTE / double-encoding (`%2500`, `%00`) \
to defeat an extension allowlist and reach backup/config files (`*.bak`, `package.json.bak`, `*.md.bak`, `.env`, coupons/keys). \
Enumerate an open `/ftp` or static dir if present.\n\
- FORGOT-PASSWORD & OSINT: the reset flow keyed on a security question — the answer is often discoverable from the app's own \
data (profile, photo-wall image captions/EXIF, reviews). Use the app's public data to answer it, then reset.\n\
- OBSERVABILITY / EXPOSURE: probe `/metrics` (Prometheus), `/support/logs`, access logs, `/redirect?to=`, GraphQL introspection, \
Swagger/OpenAPI, and any `/rest/*` that returns more fields than the UI shows (excessive data exposure — password hashes, etc.).\n\
- CLIENT-SIDE & MISC: DOM XSS where user input is written to the DOM/innerHTML (search, product name) — prove it executes; \
NoSQL operator injection (`$ne`,`$gt`,`$where`) on review/update endpoints; SSRF on any URL-fetching field (profile image URL); \
open-redirect allowlist bypass by embedding an allowlisted substring; XXE on deprecated B2B/XML interfaces; weak/guessable \
coupon or discount codes (reverse the pattern from the bundle). Force ERROR HANDLING flaws with malformed JSON / wrong types to \
surface stack traces.\n\
Chain what you find (leaked key → forged token → admin route → data export). Prove every issue with the exact request+response.\n\n";

If you proved 25 unthrottled requests, say that; do not claim inbox flooding unless you observed mail being sent. An inflated impact gets the whole finding rejected, and the real measurement is lost with it.\n\

                     A PoC script is an EXTRA artifact, never a substitute for these steps.\n\

         has no network, or hangs past the timeout, SKIP IT immediately and use an already-installed \
         alternative or plain `curl`/`nc`/`dig`/`openssl`/`python3`. Do not wait on, retry, or block the \
         whole recon for any single tool download — a missing tool is never a reason to stall. \
         Options — `pip install <t>`, `go install <pkg>@latest`, `npm i -g <t>`, or `cargo install <t>` (all time-boxed). \
         Recommended arsenal: subfinder/amass/assetfinder (subdomains), httpx/httprobe (probe live), \
         gau/waybackurls/katana/hakrawler/gospider (URL harvest & crawl), gf (pattern-filter urls), \
         arjun/paramspider (params), ffuf/feroxbuster/dirsearch (content discovery), nuclei (targeted templates), \
         nmap/rustscan/naabu (ports), dnsx (dns), subjs/linkfinder/getjs (JS endpoints), whatweb/wappalyzer (fingerprint), \
         nikto (server issues), testssl.sh/sslscan (TLS). Chain them: subfinder→httpx→katana/gau→gf→ffuf.\n\
         COVER, at this intensity: (1) subdomain & vhost enumeration + resolve live; (2) full crawl + historical \
         URLs (wayback/gau) + JS analysis (endpoints, params, secrets, source maps); (3) content & parameter \
         discovery with wordlists; (4) port/service scan; (5) tech + EXACT version fingerprinting; (6) auth/API \
         (REST+GraphQL) mapping; (7) classic exposures (.git/.env/backups/swagger/actuator, dangling CNAMEs); \
         (8) TLS/headers/cookies. Report counts (how many subdomains/urls/params/endpoints you actually found).\n\n")
