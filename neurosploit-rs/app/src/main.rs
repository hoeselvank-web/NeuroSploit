(API key or local subscription: Claude/Codex/Gemini/Grok/OpenCode/Hermes) to autonomously test a target. \
After recon it INTELLIGENTLY selects only the agents matching the discovered surface, runs \
them in parallel, then validates every finding by cross-model voting before reporting.\n\n\
Run with NO arguments for an interactive wizard.\n\n\
EXAMPLES:\n  \
# Black-box against a known test site (subscription, Opus, browser via Playwright if present)\n  \
neurosploit run http://testphp.vulnweb.com/ --subscription --model anthropic:claude-opus-4-8 --mcp -v\n\n  \
# Black-box via API keys with a multi-model voting panel\n  \
neurosploit run http://testphp.vulnweb.com/ --model anthropic:claude-opus-4-8 --model openai:gpt-5.1 --vote-n 3\n\n  \
# White-box source review of a cloned repo (DVWA)\n  \
git clone https://github.com/digininja/DVWA /tmp/DVWA\n  \
neurosploit whitebox /tmp/DVWA --subscription --model anthropic:claude-opus-4-8 -v\n\n  \
# Offline pipeline self-test (no keys/login)\n  \
neurosploit run http://testphp.vulnweb.com/ --offline\n\n\
TIP: run inside Kali Linux (or `docker run -it kalilinux/kali-rolling`) so curl/nmap/rustscan/ffuf are available."
