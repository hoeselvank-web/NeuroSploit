//! NeuroSploit v3.6.5 harness — a robust multi-model runtime for the
//! markdown-driven autonomous pentest engine.
//!
//! The harness loads the `agents_md/` library, drives a *pool* of LLM models
//! (any OpenAI-compatible provider) with concurrency + provider failover, runs
//! the specialist agents in parallel, then validates every candidate finding by
//! **N-model voting** before scoring and reporting.
