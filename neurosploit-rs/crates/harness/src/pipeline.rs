- Crawl pages, forms and parameters; record every input, header, cookie and redirect.\n\
- DOWNLOAD the linked JavaScript bundles (curl each script) and ANALYZE them: extract API endpoints/routes, hidden/undocumented parameters, GraphQL operations, secrets / API keys / tokens, cloud & third-party URLs, feature flags, and `sourceMappingURL` references (fetch source maps if exposed to recover original source).\n\
- Fingerprint the tech stack and EXACT versions (server, framework, libraries, CMS, JS libs) from headers, HTML, asset paths and JS.\n\
- Analyze responses deeply: status codes, ALL headers, Set-Cookie flags, verbose errors/stack traces, content types, and length/timing differentials.\n\
- Map auth (cookie/JWT/OAuth), APIs (REST & GraphQL), and any dev/staging/internal hosts referenced anywhere.\n\
- BUG-BOUNTY RECON TRICKS (use what's installed; degrade gracefully): expand scope — subdomains via crt.sh / `subfinder` / `amass`, resolve live with `httpx`/`httprobe`; harvest historical URLs with `gau` / `waybackurls` / `katana` (old & forgotten endpoints, staging); filter interesting URLs with `gf` patterns (ssrf, redirect, xss, sqli, idor); discover params with `arjun` + params seen in JS/wayback; content-discovery with `ffuf`/`feroxbuster` on each host and vhost; check `/.git`,`/.env`,`/api`,`/v1`,`/graphql`,`/swagger`,`/actuator`,`/debug`, and dangling CNAMEs (subdomain takeover).

Don't run payloads that the response makes irrelevant.\n\
- Map & CONNECT routes: build the route/endpoint graph and link one endpoint to another — an id/token/filename returned by endpoint A is the input to endpoint B; follow multi-step flows (login → profile → order → admin) and hunt the SENSITIVE ones (auth, password reset, payment, file upload/download, account/role changes, admin, export).\n\
- Mine PARAMETERS: enumerate query/body/header/cookie params (incl. hidden ones from JS/source maps); for each, reason about what it does and test the fitting attack (IDOR, injection, path traversal, mass-assignment, open-redirect, SSRF). Add plausible params the API might accept (id, user, role, admin, debug, redirect, file, callback).\n\
- MOCK realistic data: when a request needs valid-looking input to reach deeper logic, synthesize believable test data (emails, names, CPFs/SSNs with valid checksums, phone numbers, UUIDs, tokens, JSON bodies) so the flow proceeds — never use real PII.\n\
- Authenticated testing: if you can authenticate (given creds/roles or a login you performed), REUSE the session and exploit the AUTHENTICATED surface — the endpoints/params only reachable while logged in are where the high-impact bugs live. Test as EACH role you have (e.g. normal user AND admin) and compare.\n\
- Self-register when no creds are given: if the app allows sign-up, ANALYZE the register form (probe `form_details` has action/method/fields) and CREATE one clearly-marked benign test account (`nrsplt_<rand>@example.test`) — with curl (GET for CSRF+cookies, then POST the fields) or the Playwright browser for JS-rendered/multi-step forms — then log in and REUSE that session for authenticated testing. Register a second account only when a test needs two users. Non-destructive: one account, no mass-registration/spam; at signup also try mass-assignment (`role=admin`/`isAdmin`) and report it if accepted.\n\
- Build PoCs when needed: for issues that need an artifact to prove (clickjacking → an HTML page that frames the target; CSRF → an auto-submitting HTML form; a multi-step or timing exploit → a script), WRITE the PoC to the run's PoC dir, run/validate it, and cite the file in the evidence.\n\
- Test control BYPASSES: when something returns 401/403/redirect or is 'blocked', try to bypass it (verb tampering, path/case/encoding normalization, X-Original-URL / X-Rewrite-URL / X-Forwarded-* headers, missing-vs-invalid token, direct object/API access) and confirm the bypass with the two requests.\n\n";

- Think in primitives, not labels: reduce the foothold to what it GIVES you (code exec, file read, file write, request forgery, a trusted identity, a leaked secret, arbitrary object access) and pick the next step from that.\n\
- Pivot playbook (attempt the fitting ones, prove each with a benign receipt):\n\
  · File upload / write → RCE: upload a webshell/handler to an executable path or poison a config/`.htaccess`/cron/serialized file; prove with a benign marker (`id`, unique echo, OOB DNS), not damage.\n\
  · SSRF → cloud/host takeover: hit `169.254.169.254` (IMDSv1/v2), GCP/Azure metadata, internal admin/actuator, `file://`/`gopher://`; loot temp creds/tokens and REUSE them.\n\
  · SQLi → RCE/LPE: stacked queries, `INTO OUTFILE`/`COPY … TO`, UDF, `xp_cmdshell`, read secrets/creds; then reuse creds to log in and escalate.\n\
  · LFI/path traversal → RCE: log/session/wrapper poisoning, `/proc/self/environ`, read source & secrets; combine with an upload for exec.\n\
  · XXE → SSRF/file read → creds; deserialization/SSTI → RCE via a gadget/template sink; prove exec with a marker.\n\
  · IDOR/BOLA/mass-assignment → account/tenant takeover or role escalation (`role=admin`); open-redirect/XSS/CORS → token/session theft → ATO.\n\
  · Exposed `.git`/backup/`.env`/secrets → reconstruct source & keys → auth to internal APIs, cloud, DB; default/leaked creds → domain/service compromise.\n\
- Reuse loot relentlessly: every credential/JWT/cookie/API key/host you obtain is input to the next step — carry it forward across modules and try it everywhere it might be accepted.\n\
- Understand the BUSINESS & LOGIC: reason about what the app is FOR (payments, orders, tenancy, KYC, entitlements) and chain toward business impact — payment/price/coupon abuse, cross-tenant data access, entitlement/limit bypass, workflow/state-machine skips (skip approval/verification steps), race conditions on balance/stock. These compound: each finding updates your model of the app for the next probe.\n\
- Stop at proof: demonstrate the impact with the SMALLEST safe step and report the CHAIN end-to-end; never destroy, overwrite, encrypt, mass-exfiltrate, or DoS to 'prove' it.\n\n";

/// Methodology directions for a modern JS SPA backed by a REST/GraphQL API
/// (Angular/React/Vue front + Node/Express-style API — the shape of OWASP Juice
/// Shop and many real apps). These are DIRECTIONS on HOW to hunt each vuln class,
/// NOT a challenge answer key: the agent still discovers, tests and PROVES each
/// issue against the live app. Injected only when recon shows a SPA/REST surface.
const SPA_API_DOCTRINE: &str = "SPA + REST/API METHODOLOGY (modern JS app — hunt the API, not just the shell):\n\
- MAP THE API FROM THE BUNDLE: curl the main JS bundle(s) (`main*.js`, `runtime*.js`, `vendor*.js`) and grep for route \
paths and API calls — client routes (Angular/React router table), `/rest/…`, `/api/…`, GraphQL, and any `http(s)://` / \
relative endpoints, param names, and hardcoded secrets/keys/emails. Build the real endpoint list from the code, then hit it.\n\
- HIDDEN CLIENT ROUTES: SPA pages are client-side and often unlinked — extract the router table from the bundle AND brute \
common ones (`#/administration`, `#/admin`, `#/accounting`, `#/score-board`, `#/wallet`, `#/deluxe-membership`); a route that \
renders admin/score/scoreboard content is a broken-access-control finding.\n\
- AUTH & SQLi: on the login endpoint try SQLi auth bypass (`' OR 1=1--`, `admin@…'--`, tautologies) in the email/username; on \
search/query params try error-based then UNION SELECT to exfil the schema and user table (email+password hash). Also test \
weak/default admin creds and account/email ENUMERATION (different response for existing vs unknown user).\n\
- JWT: decode any JWT; test alg:none / 'unsigned' acceptance, RS256→HS256 confusion using the server's public key as the HMAC \
secret, `kid`/`jku` injection, and whether the signature is verified at all — forge a token impersonating another/admin user.\n\
- IDOR / BOLA / mass-assignment: numeric or guessable ids on `/api/<Object>/:id` (baskets, orders, feedbacks, reviews, users) \
— change the id or the owner field to read/modify another user's data; at REGISTER/PATCH add unexpected fields (`role=admin`, \
`isAdmin`, `deletedAt`, `id`) and check if the server binds them (privilege escalation / resurrecting deleted accounts).\n\
- FILE ACCESS: file/download/ftp endpoints — path traversal (`../`), and POISON NULL BYTE / double-encoding (`%2500`, `%00`) \
to defeat an extension allowlist and reach backup/config files (`*.bak`, `package.json.bak`, `*.md.bak`, `.env`, coupons/keys). \
Enumerate an open `/ftp` or static dir if present.\n\
- FORGOT-PASSWORD & OSINT: the reset flow keyed on a security question — the answer is often discoverable from the app's own \
data (profile, photo-wall image captions/EXIF, reviews). Use the app's public data to answer it, then reset.\n\
- OBSERVABILITY / EXPOSURE: probe `/metrics` (Prometheus), `/support/logs`, access logs, `/redirect?to=`, GraphQL introspection, \
Swagger/OpenAPI, and any `/rest/*` that returns more fields than the UI shows (excessive data exposure — password hashes, etc.).\n\
- CLIENT-SIDE & MISC: DOM XSS where user input is written to the DOM/innerHTML (search, product name) — prove it executes; \
NoSQL operator injection (`$ne`,`$gt`,`$where`) on review/update endpoints; SSRF on any URL-fetching field (profile image URL); \
open-redirect allowlist bypass by embedding an allowlisted substring; XXE on deprecated B2B/XML interfaces; weak/guessable \
coupon or discount codes (reverse the pattern from the bundle). Force ERROR HANDLING flaws with malformed JSON / wrong types to \
surface stack traces.\n\
Chain what you find (leaked key → forged token → admin route → data export). Prove every issue with the exact request+response.\n\n";
