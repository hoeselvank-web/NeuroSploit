//! Proof-of-concept validation — re-running a finding to see if it still holds.
//!
//! A finding is a claim about the past: *when I sent this, that happened*. The
//! report inherits that claim on trust. But between the moment an agent proved
//! something and the moment a client reads it, three things routinely change
//! the answer — the bug got hotfixed, the "proof" was a fluke that does not
//! reproduce, or the evidence was of an interaction the application never
//! actually performed. A PoC validator is the harness checking its own work
//! before it ships:
//!
//! ```text
//!   finding ──→ rebuild the request ──→ send it again ──→ compare to what
//!                                            │              was claimed
//!                                            ▼
//!                        REPRODUCED · CHANGED · GONE · UNVERIFIABLE
//! ```
//!
//! The distinction that matters is the last two. **GONE** means the request
//! ran cleanly and the effect is no longer there — a finding to demote, or a
//! remediation to confirm. **UNVERIFIABLE** means the harness could not run the
//! check at all (out of scope now, a state-changing request it will not repeat,
//! nothing recorded to replay). Collapsing those two is the classic mistake: a
//! PoC that *could not be tested* is not a PoC that *failed*, and reporting the
//! first as the second quietly drops real bugs.
//!
//! What this is **not**: it is not a second discovery pass. It re-runs what a
//! finding already recorded and asks "does this still reproduce", using the
//! same deterministic validators the pipeline used the first time. It never
//! invents a new payload, and it never *upgrades* a finding — the strongest
//! thing it can say is "still true", and the most useful is "no longer true".
