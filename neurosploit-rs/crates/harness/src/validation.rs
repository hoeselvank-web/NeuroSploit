//! Evidence & Validation Engine — deterministic, per-CWE, outside the model.
//!
//! Today a finding becomes "validated" by asking more language models: N-model
//! voting, then an adversarial refute pass. That catches sloppy reasoning, but
//! it shares the failure mode of the thing it checks — models agreeing with
//! each other is not evidence, and a confident hallucination survives a vote by
//! being confident. [`crate::grounding`] adds a receipt requirement, but it
//! matches keywords ("http/", "status", "alert(") and cannot tell a real
//! response apart from a plausible transcript of one.
//!
//! This engine asks a different question: **does the recorded evidence actually
//! demonstrate this specific weakness?** The rule is per-CWE because the answer
//! is: SQL injection is proven by a reproducible, deterministic difference
//! between a baseline and an attack response; XSS is proven by a browser
//! executing a marker the harness chose; IDOR is proven by identity B reading
//! identity A's resource *and* the response carrying A's data. None of those
//! reduce to "the evidence looks technical".
//!
//! ```text
//!   HYPOTHESIS   an agent noticed something
//!        │
//!   CANDIDATE    a reproducible interaction was built
//!        │
//!   ┌────┴──────────────────────┐
//!   │   VALIDATION ENGINE       │   deterministic, per-CWE, no LLM
//!   └────┬──────────────────────┘
//!   PASS │ UNCERTAIN │ FAIL
//!        ▼           ▼         ▼
//!   CONFIRMED   NEEDS_REVIEW  REJECTED
//! ```
//!
//! Two rules keep the engine honest:
//!
//! 1. **Absent evidence is never a pass.** A class with no validator, or a
//!    finding whose evidence was never captured, lands in `NeedsReview` — the
//!    engine says "I could not prove this", never "this is fine".
//! 2. **It can refuse, and it can confirm, but it cannot invent.** A verdict is
//!    a function of recorded artifacts. Nothing here consults a model.
