//! The Evidence Prosecutor — a second judge that only asks what was observed.
//!
//! The existing voters answer "is this finding real?", which invites them to
//! judge the whole narrative at once. That is how a proven missing control got
//! deleted for having an overstated headline: one lever, one verdict, and the
//! observation went out with the story.
//!
//! This judge has a narrower brief, and four questions in a fixed order:
//!
//! 1. What exactly did we observe?
//! 2. Which sentence in the finding goes beyond that?
//! 3. What would have to be observed for the claimed impact to become factual?
//! 4. **Can the finding survive if the impact sentence is removed?**
//!
//! The fourth is the one that decides retain-versus-reject, and it is why this
//! judge cannot delete anything. It returns a *minimal claim* — the largest
//! statement the ledger supports — and [`crate::claims`] rebuilds the finding
//! from it. A prosecutor that could also pass sentence would just be the old
//! voter with a better prompt.

Answer four questions, in order:\n\
1. What exactly was OBSERVED? Quote only what appears in the evidence ledger.\n\
2. Which sentences in the finding go BEYOND what was observed? List them verbatim.\n\
3. What would have to be observed for the claimed impact to become factual? Be concrete (a confirmed account, a delivered email, returned data, command output).\n\
4. If every unsupported sentence were removed, would a security-relevant statement remain? If yes, write that statement as `minimal_claim` — the largest claim the evidence fully supports.\n\
Rules: a claim with no supporting evidence id is unsupported no matter how plausible. Absence of a control (no 429, no HSTS, no lockout) IS security-relevant on its own. Do not soften or restate the observation — quote it.\n\
