# NeuroSploit v3.6.8 — Release Notes

**Release Date:** August 2026
**Codename:** Chain & Exploit
**License:** MIT
**Credits:** Joas A Santos & Red Team Leaders

## v3.6.8 — Auth resilience, circuit breaker, recon budget, Ollama error handling, empty-evidence validation

### Recon Time Budget (NEW)

- **5-minute total recon budget.** Recon phase is now time-boxed to 300 seconds
  across ALL rounds. Previously, a single recon round could run 150+ commands
  over 15 minutes via subscription CLI, leaving no time for exploitation.
- **Per-round budget directive.** Each recon round receives a prompt instruction
  with its share of the time budget (e.g. "~100 seconds for this round") and a
  command count guideline (30-50 commands max). The model is instructed to
  prioritise high-signal actions and stop early when enough intel is gathered.
- **Elapsed time check between rounds.** Before starting each follow-up round,
  the pipeline checks elapsed time. If the budget is exhausted, recon stops
  immediately and proceeds to exploitation with the intelligence gathered so far.

### Auth Resilience & Circuit Breaker (NEW)

- **`is_auth_failure()` detector.** New function recognises OAuth token revocation
  (401), session expiry, invalid/revoked API keys, and "not logged in" errors from
  subscription CLIs. Distinct from `is_exhaustion()` (quota/rate-limit) — auth
  failures are non-recoverable without re-login or provider switch.
- **Circuit breaker (3 consecutive auth failures → auto-pause).** A shared atomic
  counter tracks consecutive auth failures across ALL agents. After 3 failures the
  pool pauses the run BEFORE burning through the remaining agents on a dead token.
  Previously, a revoked OAuth token caused all 66+ agents to silently return 0
  findings with no pause or warning.
- **Auth-aware park: findings preserved, fallback offered.** When auth fails the
  run parks with a clear message:
  `⏸ authentication failed (...). Run is PAUSED — all findings so far are SAFE.`
  The user can `/continue openai:gpt-5.1` (or any provider) to switch and resume.
  All `LiveCheckpoint` findings on disk are preserved across the pause.
- **No retry burn on auth failure.** `one()` returns immediately on auth errors
  instead of retrying 3 times against a dead token (same as quota exhaustion).
- **Recon preserves probe facts on auth failure.** When model recon fails with an
  auth error, the HTTP probe data is still returned and the pipeline continues
  with probe-only intelligence instead of silently dropping everything.
- **Phase tracking for auth pauses.** The REPL status line shows `paused (auth)`
  (distinct from `paused (quota)`) so the operator knows the root cause at a glance.

### Bugfixes

- **Better Ollama/local provider error messages.** Connection-refused and timeout
  errors now name the provider, URL, and suggest checking if the server is running.
  Previously showed raw reqwest errors.
- **Empty-evidence findings skip the vote and go straight to `needs-review`.**
  Findings with no evidence are unverifiable by the adversarial validator (which
  always rejects "no evidence" per its system prompt). Now they bypass the vote
  and are flagged for human review instead of being silently dropped.
- **Single-model + vote_n=1 warning.** When only one model is configured and
  vote_n is 1, the pipeline emits a warning that validation is weaker (same model
  validates its own findings).
- **JSON parse resilience for local models.** `extract_findings` now logs when a
  model returns text but no parseable JSON (previously silent drop — 0 findings
  with no diagnostic). Also auto-fixes trailing-comma JSON (`[...,]`) which small
  models commonly produce.
- **Visible diagnostics when agents return 0 findings.** Pipeline emits the
  response tail so the operator can see what the model actually returned (helps
  debug model quality issues with local/small models).

---

## v3.6.7 Highlights

- **CVE exploitation pipeline — 4 new agents.** `cve_version_fingerprint` (pin
  exact versions) → `cve_research_analyst` (map to NVD/GHSA, judge reachability) →
  `cve_poc_finder` (locate/vet/adapt a public PoC) → `cve_exploit_scripter` (write
  a custom exploit when none exists). Focus: actually exploiting vulns that have
  CVEs, not just flagging versions.
- **PoCs land in the run's `pocs/` folder and are listed in the report.** Every
  agent writes runnable proofs to `$NEUROSPLOIT_POCS`; the report gains a
  **"Reproduction — PoC scripts"** section so findings replay end-to-end.
- **Chaining for any primitive.** New `CHAIN_DOCTRINE` + a `chain_cve_to_rce_to_pivot`
  recipe turn any confirmed foothold into the next step (upload→RCE, SSRF→cloud
  creds, IDOR→takeover, CVE→RCE→pivot), reusing looted creds and reasoning about
  **business logic** — strictly non-destructive (no data loss / DB overwrite / DoS).
- **`--only <agent>` — re-test a single vulnerability.** Runs exactly the named
  agent(s), skipping recon selection. On `run` / `whitebox` / `greybox`; repeatable
  or comma/semicolon-separated. (Implements the previously-dead `pinned` allowlist.)
- **White-box stays white-box.** A `WHITEBOX_DOCTRINE` keeps code agents in static
  source-review mode (symbolic `file:line` receipts, source→sink taint, manifest
  version→CVE) and blocks hallucinated live/black-box network actions; agents can
  emit a repro PoC.
- **435 markdown agents** (was 430).

# NeuroSploit v3.6.5 — Release Notes

**Release Date:** July 2026
**Codename:** LLM Red Team
**License:** MIT
**Credits:** Joas A Santos & Red Team Leaders

---

## Highlights

- **Human-in-the-loop validator — uncertain findings are flagged, not deleted.**
  The vote, receipt-grounding and adversarial-refute passes no longer silently
  drop borderline findings. A finding is now **`confirmed`** (passed all three) or
  **`needs-review`** (partial vote, no machine-verifiable receipt, or failed
  refute) — kept with a reason so a human makes the final call. Only zero-support
  noise is dropped. Every report separates the two buckets.

- **Richer reports in Markdown + JSON (alongside PDF/HTML).** Every run writes
  `report.md`, `report.json`, `report.html` and the Typst **PDF** via
  `report::write_all`, now with a full structure: **asset identification** (names
  the product/organisation + tech stack — e.g. "OWASP Juice Shop [Angular,
  Express]" — not just the URL), a **written executive summary**, a
  **vulnerability table** (severity · status · CWE/OWASP), a **test-accounts
  section** (from the vault, to delete after), detailed confirmed findings, a
  separate **needs-review** section, and a **written conclusion**. The asset is
  identified during the run: a deterministic probe extracts the page title,
  fingerprints the stack, matches known apps, and reads a business/brand hint
  (`og:site_name` / `application-name` / copyright) into `meta.json`.

- **Sharper agents on modern SPA/REST apps (Juice-Shop-class).** When recon
  detects a JS SPA and/or a REST/GraphQL API, a methodology directive gives agents
  concrete **directions** (not an answer key) on how to hunt each class: map the API
  from the JS bundle, brute hidden client routes (`#/administration`, score board),
  SQLi login-bypass/UNION, JWT alg:none & RS→HS forging, IDOR/BOLA + mass-assignment,
  path-traversal + poison-null-byte file access, forgot-password/OSINT, exposed
  `/metrics`, DOM XSS, NoSQL, SSRF, redirect-allowlist bypass, XXE, coupon crypto.
  Agents still discover and PROVE each issue live.

- **More robust RL.** Per-agent reward is now shaped: strong for a **confirmed**
  finding (severity × confidence), small for a **needs-review** lead, slight decay
  for running but finding nothing — so agents that reliably land confirmed
  high-severity bugs rise to the top of selection over runs (persisted).

- **LLM red-teaming — jailbreaks & prompt injection across scenarios.** 12 new AI
  agents (AI category 18 → **30**; total 417 → **429**) that adversarially test a
  live AI system (LLM app / AI agent / MCP server) the way
  [hackagent.dev](https://hackagent.dev)-style tooling does. Each agent runs an
  **attacker → LLM-judge loop**: capture the baseline refusal, apply the technique
  across several scenarios/variants, then judge with an explicit criterion whether
  the guardrail was *actually* bypassed — proving it with a **benign, redacted**
  prompt+response receipt (never real harm).
  - **Jailbreak techniques:** `AdvPrefix` (adversarial prefix/suffix), `PAIR`
    (automated iterative refinement), `TAP` (tree-of-attacks with pruning),
    `Crescendo` (multi-turn escalation), many-shot, persona/DAN roleplay,
    encoding/obfuscation (base64/ROT13/zero-width/low-resource-language),
    refusal-suppression / prefix injection.
  - **Prompt-injection & hijacking scenarios:** direct injection, **indirect**
    injection via RAG doc / web page / email / tool output, **goal hijacking**,
    agentic **tool/function-call abuse**, and **system-prompt / secret
    exfiltration**.
  - Runs via `neurosploit aitest <ai-url>` (or the REPL **AI Agents & LLMs**
    onboarding scope). A new `REDTEAM_DOCTRINE` steers every AI test through the
    baseline→technique→judge loop. Complements the existing OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025),
    MCP and Skills/n8n agents. Authorized, non-destructive.

- **New models.** Added **Claude Opus 5** and **Claude Sonnet 5** (Anthropic),
  and a new **Moonshot AI (Kimi)** provider with **Kimi K3** / K2 (`moonshot:kimi-k3`,
  `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`, OpenAI-compatible) — **15 providers** total. Use any of them
  as a finder or in the validator voting panel, e.g.
  `--model anthropic:claude-opus-5 --model moonshot:kimi-k3`.

- **Liveness preflight.** Before recon, the run confirms the target actually
  answers HTTP; a dead host prints `✗ target unreachable — … is DOWN` and aborts
  instead of running agents against nothing. A reachable host prints `✓ target is UP`.

- **Account registration & form analysis (+1 agent → total 430).** A new
  `account_registration_and_forms` agent lets NeuroSploit reach the authenticated
  surface on its own: it analyzes the app's forms (the deterministic probe now
  extracts each `<form>`'s action/method/fields/kind/CSRF) and creates a benign
  test account with **curl** or the **Playwright browser** when no creds are given.
  When no `--auth`/creds are set on a web run, this agent is **run first
  automatically** so the authenticated surface is always attempted (and visible).
  - **Anti-flood guardrail (hard):** at most **2 accounts per engagement**, never
    looping/scripting/batching the register endpoint or flooding the database —
    reuse the account made; a test needing many sign-ups is reported as a lead and
    stopped. Enforced in `SAFETY_DOCTRINE` (all flows) and the agent.
  - **Credential vault:** every generated credential is saved to
    **`.neurosploit/vault/<run-id>.json`** for the operator to consult; secrets are **masked in
    the report**. The report adds a **"Test accounts created (DELETE after)"**
    cleanup section listing each account and how it was created.
  - **Finding labels:** findings are tagged **`auth_context`**
    (authenticated/unauthenticated) and **`account`** (which test user/role proved
    it) — so grey-box shows which findings needed a login, and black-box records how
    the user was created.
  - **Disposable email (opt-in, off by default):** `/tempmail on` (or `temp_email`)
    lets agents use the free **mail.tm** API (no key) to read a registration
    confirmation code; off by default, a required confirmation is reported as a
    blocker rather than bypassed.

## Previously in v3.6.4


- **Fix ([#33](https://github.com/JoasASantos/NeuroSploit/issues/33)): white-box
  findings were silently dropped from the report.** The grounding gate — the
  anti-hallucination step that demotes any claim lacking a receipt — was running
  in **empirical** mode for *every* engagement. Empirical grounding looks for raw
  tool output (HTTP responses, error oracles, shell receipts), which a **SAST
  finding never has**: its receipt is a `file:line` reference into the reviewed
  source. So white-box (and skills/n8n audit) findings that had *passed* the
  n-model vote were then demoted as "receipt missing" and never reported.
  Grounding is now **mode-aware**:
  - **Symbolic** — white-box SAST & skills audits: a `file:line` (or
    `file:section`) reference into the reviewed source, or a quote of code that
    appears in it, IS the receipt. No live target needed.
  - **Empirical** — black-box / host / AI endpoints: evidence must resemble raw
    tool output (unchanged behaviour).
  - **Either** — grey-box: a source citation OR a tool receipt grounds a finding.
  The symbolic check is run against the reviewed **source corpus** (not the model
  transcript), and falls back to a structural `file:line` + code-quote check when
  the corpus isn't available, so a well-formed SAST finding is never dropped on a
  technicality. Covered by unit tests (including a regression test for #33).

---

## Previously in v3.6.3

- **Interrupted runs are resumable.** When a run is cut off (terminal closed,
  Ctrl-C, crash, SSH drop), its findings were already checkpointed live and
  recovered as a run on the next launch. Now `/continue` (or `/resume`) also
  **relaunches the engagement** on the same target and **carries those findings
  forward** — steering agents to widen coverage and chain from what was already
  found instead of re-reporting it. The offer is shown at launch right under the
  recovery line. A fresh `/run` supersedes the pending resume.
- **Browsing no longer kills a live run.** Opening `/results`, `/finding` or
  `/report` while a run streams used to let the background printer and the
  full-screen picker fight over the terminal — pressing Ctrl-C to escape could
  take the whole process down. Live output is now paused while any picker is
  open (still captured in `/logs`) and restored when you exit, so browsing
  findings mid-run is safe.
- Findings merge (dedup by title + endpoint) across the interrupted and
  continued runs, and the merged report is rewritten to include everything.

---

## Previously in v3.6.2

- **Codex now streams live, tool-by-tool.** `codex exec` is driven with `--json`
  and its JSONL event stream is parsed into the same categorized activity feed
  as Claude Code: every shell command it runs (`exec:`), file edit (`edit:`),
  MCP tool call (`tool:`), web search (`net:`) and token count appears the moment
  it happens. A long, intense recon (subfinder → httpx → katana → nmap …) is no
  longer a silent black box — you watch each tool execute.
- **`/logs` and `/status` now capture what each agent actually runs.** The
  activity feed previously dropped the per-agent tool events; it now keeps the
  actionable ones (commands, network, files, findings) and only filters long
  model reasoning and token telemetry. `/logs` shows the real command trail;
  `/status` `last:` shows a true sign-of-life.
- Failed internal commands surface as `exec: (exit N) <cmd>` instead of
  silently vanishing, and Codex auth/rate errors are still detected from stderr.

---

## Previously in v3.6.1

- **Added the GPT-5.6 model line** (OpenAI / ChatGPT): `openai:gpt-5.6-sol`
  (frontier / default), `openai:gpt-5.6-terra` (balanced), and
  `openai:gpt-5.6-luna` (fast & affordable) — alongside the existing GPT-5.x,
  Claude (incl. Sonnet 5), Grok 4.5 and the rest of the provider pool.
- Everything from v3.6.0 (AI/LLM/MCP/Skills testing, n8n audit, onboarding
  wizard, intense multi-round recon) carries forward unchanged.

# NeuroSploit v3.6.0 — Release Notes

**Release Date:** July 2026
**Codename:** AI / LLM / Agent / MCP / Skills Security
**License:** MIT
**Credits:** Joas A Santos & Red Team Leaders

---

## TL;DR

v3.6.0 turns NeuroSploit into an **AI-security** platform: red-team live AI
agents / LLM apps / MCP endpoints against the **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Apps (2025)**
+ MCP threats, audit **AI Skills/plugins and exported n8n workflows** white-box,
and pick your engagement type up front in a new **onboarding wizard**. Library
**417** agents. Adds **Claude Sonnet 5** and **Grok 4.5**.

## AI / LLM / Agent / MCP / Skills testing (+18 agents, `agents_md/ai/`)

- **Live AI red-team** — `neurosploit aitest <url>` (or the `ai` scope in the
  REPL). Point it at an AI agent / LLM chat or API / MCP endpoint; agents cover
  the full **OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025)**: prompt injection (direct + indirect),
  jailbreaks, system-prompt leakage, sensitive-info disclosure, improper output
  handling, excessive agency, RAG/embedding weaknesses, unbounded consumption,
  supply chain, misinformation — hackagent.dev-style, with the exact prompt +
  the model's response as proof. Plus **MCP risks**: tool poisoning / description
  injection, excessive permissions & confused-deputy, unsafe tool execution.
- **Skills / plugins / n8n audit (white-box)** — `neurosploit skills <file|dir>`
  (or the `skills` scope). Audit a single `.md`/`.json` or a whole folder:
  - **Skills/plugins**: insecure design, secrets in manifests, over-broad tools,
    injection surface, missing human-in-the-loop.
  - **n8n exported workflows**: hardcoded credentials, unsafe Code/Function
    nodes (RCE/SSRF), unauthenticated webhooks, expression injection, over-scoped
    credentials — **and a dedicated AI/LLM-node audit** (prompt injection, data
    leakage to the provider, excessive agency, insecure output handling).

## Onboarding wizard

- On first launch (or `/onboard`), a guided menu asks **what you're testing** —
  **Web & API · Infrastructure & Networks · Cloud · AI Agents & LLMs · AI
  Skills/Plugins/n8n** — then the box type (black/white/grey for web) and the
  minimal setup, so a plain `/run` does the right thing. Scope shown in `/show`.

## Intense, multi-round recon

- Recon is no longer a single quick pass. **`deep_recon`** runs an initial deep
  enumeration then **follow-up expansion rounds** that chase what the previous
  round found (new subdomains/hosts, unmapped endpoints, promising paths/params),
  converging when nothing new appears.
- Agents are told to **install the tools they need** (apt/pip/go/npm/cargo) —
  subfinder/amass, httpx, gau/waybackurls/katana/hakrawler, gf, arjun/paramspider,
  ffuf/feroxbuster, nuclei, nmap/rustscan, dnsx, linkfinder, whatweb, nikto,
  testssl — and chain them (subfinder→httpx→katana/gau→gf→ffuf).
- **`/recon <1-4>`** (REPL) and **`--recon <1-4>`** (CLI) set the intensity:
  1 quick · 2 standard · 3 deep (default) · 4 exhaustive — more rounds + wider
  enumeration at higher levels. Best on Kali; degrades to curl/nc if installs fail.

## Models

- Added **`anthropic:claude-sonnet-5`** and **`xai:grok-4.5`**.

# NeuroSploit v3.5.6 — Release Notes

**Release Date:** July 2026
**Codename:** Bug-Bounty Corpus & EOL Hunting
**License:** MIT
**Credits:** Joas A Santos & Red Team Leaders

---

## TL;DR

v3.5.6 folds real public bug-bounty knowledge into the agent (methodology
meta-agent + corpus-grounded techniques), adds a full **2FA/MFA bypass** agent
(one of the most-reported classes in the writeup corpus), and ships the EOL /
end-of-support hunting and decision-driven exploitation from the 3.5.5 line.
Library **399** agents.

## Highlights

- **Bug-bounty methodology, grounded in the real corpus.** The
  `bugbounty_methodology` meta-agent is validated against the actual technique
  distribution in public writeup collections (Awesome-Bugbounty-Writeups,
  bug-bounty-reference) — XSS, RCE, CSRF, SSRF, Clickjacking, SQLi, CORS, LFI,
  **2FA bypass**, subdomain/account takeover, OAuth, race, **SAML** — and now
  includes explicit **2FA/MFA bypass** and **SAML/SSO** sections.
- **New `twofa_bypass_techniques` agent** — the full 2FA-bypass playbook (missing
  rate-limit brute, code reuse/no-expiry, response manipulation, step skipping,
  null/default codes, backup/remember-me, race, disable-2FA IDOR, SSO side door),
  with a control-vs-bypass proof and no account lockout.
- **KingOfBugBounty-style recon** in `RECON_SYS` (subdomains, wayback, gf, param
  mining, content discovery, classic exposures) — from 3.5.5, degrades to
  installed tools.
- Carries the 3.5.5 features: EOL/end-of-support agents, decision-driven deep
  exploitation, multi-role `/auth`, browser-driven SPA testing, global install.
- **README**: Trendshift badge added.

# NeuroSploit v3.5.5 — Release Notes

**Release Date:** July 2026
**Codename:** Cloud Testing, REPL Navigation & Deeper Recon
**License:** MIT
**Credits:** Joas A Santos & Red Team Leaders

---

## TL;DR

v3.5.5 adds **cloud infrastructure testing** (AWS / GCP / Azure) with first-class
credential connection, **27 new agents** (17 cloud + 10 misconfig/CVE/PoC/rate-
limit → library **375**), a much more capable and navigable **REPL** (idle
guardrail, multi-target, results browser), **deeper recon** (downloads & analyzes
JS, request/response differentials, smart nuclei), **Burp/ZAP proxy** support, a
**PoC** workspace, a strict **data-safety/PII guardrail**, and a fix for garbled
interactive line-editing.

## Cloud testing

- **+17 cloud agents.** AWS, GCP and Azure specialists in
  `agents_md/infra/`: IAM/RBAC privilege escalation, storage exposure
  (S3 / GCS / Blob), compute & network exposure + IMDS, secrets (Secrets Manager /
  Secret Manager / Key Vault), service-account & service-principal abuse, and
  Entra ID enumeration — plus a multi-cloud footprint/identity recon agent.
  Read-only-first, non-destructive.
- **Connect cloud credentials via `creds.yaml`** (`aws:`, `gcp:`, `azure:`
  blocks). The harness exports the right env vars so `aws` / `gcloud` / `az` pick
  them up automatically, and tells the agents how to authenticate & what to
  enumerate:
  - **AWS** — `access_key_id`/`secret_access_key`[/`session_token`]/`region`, or a `profile`.
  - **GCP** — a service-account JSON (`service_account_json`, path recommended) →
    `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` + project.
  - **Azure** — a **service principal** (`tenant_id`/`client_id`/`client_secret`/
    `subscription_id`) → `az login --service-principal`.
  - Secrets are never written to disk beyond your `creds.yaml`; inline GCP JSON is
    materialized to a temp file only to satisfy the SDK/CLI.

## REPL — navigation & control

- **Idle guardrail — `/timeout <min>`.** If no NEW finding lands within the
  window, the run soft-stops and validates what was found (`/timeout 1` = 1 min,
  `10` = 10 min, `60` = 1 hour, `0` = off). **Default 5 min.**
- **Multiple targets — `/target url1,url2,url3`.** A comma-separated list; `/run`
  tests them **sequentially** (a queue auto-advances to the next when the current
  finishes) — one report per URL.
- **`/results` navigation browser** (interactive): pick a **target/run** → pick a
  **vulnerability** → see full detail; **Esc steps back a level** (vuln → target →
  back to the live session).
- **`/report` selection**: with multiple runs, choose which report to open from a
  menu.
- **`/chain <n>`** (attack-chain depth), **`/agents list`** (library category
  counts incl. infra/cloud); **`/show`** now shows chain-depth, idle-stop and
  enabled integrations.
- **Fix:** the interactive prompt no longer embeds ANSI/newline, so line editing
  (typing, backspace, history, cursor, multiline) is no longer garbled in a real
  terminal (the readline prompt is plain; color is applied via the highlighter).

## Deeper recon & analysis (agent prompts)

- **Deterministic HTTP probe (native, `harness::probe`).** Before the model
  recon, the harness performs a **real** request/response analysis of the target
  and injects the observed facts into recon so agent-selection and exploitation
  decisions are grounded in evidence (more robust — works even when the model's
  recon is weak): status & redirect, `Server`/`X-Powered-By`/content-type, the 6
  security headers (present/missing), **cookie flags** (HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite),
  **CORS reflection** test (arbitrary Origin + credentials), tech fingerprint,
  linked scripts, form count, a **404 baseline** for soft-404 differentials, and
  a few high-signal paths (`/robots.txt`, `/.git/config`, `/.env`, …). Best-effort
  (never fatal), honors the identifying User-Agent and the Burp/ZAP proxy.
- **RECON_SYS** now crawls pages/params/headers/cookies, **downloads the linked
  JavaScript and analyzes it** (API endpoints, hidden params, GraphQL, secrets /
  keys / tokens, `sourceMappingURL` → recover original source), fingerprints
  **exact** stack versions, and does response-differential analysis; richer JSON
  schema (`js_findings`, `secrets`, `hosts`, …).
- **tool_doctrine** adds JS-analysis (linkfinder / gau / katana + grep for
  endpoints/secrets/source-maps) and request/response-analysis guidance (status,
  all headers, Set-Cookie flags, timing/length differentials, auth-vs-anon and
  valid-vs-invalid comparisons) — applied to both recon and exploitation.

## Exploitation depth, safety & Burp

- **+10 exploitation agents.** Absurd-misconfig hunters (exposed `.git`/`.env`/
  backups, debug/actuator endpoints, default creds, directory listing, exposed
  ops dashboards, permissive CORS, verbose errors), a **CVE Hunter** (fingerprint
  → correlate → safe PoC), a **PoC Developer** (writes runnable exploit scripts),
  and a **Rate-Limit / Anti-Automation** tester.
- **Data-safety / PII guardrail** injected into every exploit/chain/host prompt:
  no modifying, deleting, exfiltrating data or changing state without explicit
  permission; on PII, prove with a single **masked** sample + a count — never
  dump. When unsure an action is safe, don't do it.
- **Smart nuclei in recon** — fingerprint first, then run nuclei on **targeted**
  templates/tags/CVE ids with rate/timeouts (fast, never a blind full scan).
- **Burp/ZAP proxy** — `/proxy <url>` (or `/burp`, default `:8080`) in the REPL,
  or the `NEUROSPLOIT_PROXY` env var. Agents route curl through it (`--proxy … -k`)
  so you can inspect/replay traffic in Burp Suite while the test runs.
- **PoC workspace** — each run gets a `pocs/` directory (`$NEUROSPLOIT_POCS`);
  agents save custom, reproducible exploit scripts there and cite them as evidence.
- **Tool download** (authorized) — agents may `git clone` a specific public PoC/
  exploit repo or download a scanner when needed (reputable/pinned, reviewed).
- **Rate-limit testing** is a first-class control check (small non-disruptive
  burst → look for 429/lockout/Retry-After), never a DoS.

## Bug-bounty methodology & recon tricks

- **Bug-bounty methodology meta-agent** (`agents_md/meta/bugbounty_methodology.md`,
  library **398**) — distilled, high-signal techniques from public writeups
  (HackerOne Hacktivity, KingOfBugBounty tips, Awesome-Bugbounty-Writeups,
  bug-bounty-reference and top hunters' reports): the hunter *mindset* plus the
  concrete per-class tricks (IDOR/BOLA, 403 bypass, account takeover, SSRF→cloud,
  business logic/race, cache poisoning, subdomain takeover, GraphQL) and how to
  chain and report them — depth and proof over scanner breadth.
- **Recon upgraded with KingOfBugBounty-style tricks** — `RECON_SYS` now expands
  scope (subdomains via crt.sh/subfinder/amass → httpx), harvests historical URLs
  (gau/waybackurls/katana), filters with `gf` patterns, mines params (arjun +
  JS/wayback), content-discovers (ffuf/feroxbuster), and checks classic exposures
  (.git/.env/swagger/actuator, dangling CNAMEs). Degrades gracefully to what's
  installed; prioritises auth/reset/payment/upload/admin/export flows.

## EOL / End-of-Support exploitation

- **+8 EOL agents** (library **397**) that detect components past their vendor
  end-of-life / end-of-support window and exploit the CVEs that pile up once
  patches stop — high-value because the bugs are public and unfixed. Each pins the
  **exact version**, checks it against public EOL data (endoflife.date) + CVE
  feeds, and proves exploitability with a **safe** PoC:
  - `eol_stack_detection` — fingerprint every EOL component across the stack.
  - `eol_runtime_exploitation` — EOL PHP/Python/Node/Java/.NET/Ruby runtimes.
  - `eol_framework_exploitation` — EOL Struts/Spring/Rails/Django/Laravel/AngularJS.
  - `eol_cms_exploitation` — EOL WordPress/Drupal/Joomla/Magento core & plugins.
  - `eol_client_library` — EOL front-end libs (jQuery/AngularJS/Lodash/…).
  - `eol_webserver_exploitation` — EOL Apache/nginx/IIS/Tomcat/JBoss/WebLogic.
  - `eol_os_service` — EOL OS & services (old OpenSSH/OpenSSL/Samba, SMBv1).
  - `eol_tls_protocol` — deprecated TLS (SSLv3/1.0/1.1) & legacy protocols.

## Decision-driven deep exploitation

- **DECISION doctrine** injected into every exploit/grey/chain prompt: analyse
  responses FIRST and let the evidence pick the technique; **map & connect
  routes** (one endpoint's output feeds another's input) and hunt sensitive flows
  (auth, reset, payment, upload, admin, export); **mine parameters**
  (query/body/header/cookie + hidden ones from JS/source maps) and test the
  fitting attack per param; **mock realistic data** to reach deeper logic (never
  real PII); **exploit the authenticated surface** after logging in and compare
  each role; **build PoCs** when a proof needs an artifact; and **bypass controls**
  (verb/path/encoding/header tricks) on anything blocked.
- **Multi-role `/auth`** — set several identities in the REPL:
  `/auth admin <hdr>` · `/auth user <hdr>` (Bearer/cookie/API-key; a bare token
  becomes `Authorization: Bearer …`). With ≥2 roles the run gets the access-control
  directive (IDOR/BOLA/BFLA/privesc, authorized-vs-unauthorized proof) and tests
  both scenarios. (Same as the `creds.yaml` role blocks, now one command away.)
- **+6 decision agents** (library **389**): `param_miner`, `endpoint_flow_linker`,
  `authenticated_surface_exploit`, `clickjacking_poc` (writes a framing HTML PoC),
  `csrf_poc` (writes an auto-submitting HTML PoC), and `access_control_bypass`.

## Browser-driven testing & SPA agents (Juice Shop-ready)

- **Agents now actively drive the browser while testing.** The tool doctrine was
  strengthened: on JS-heavy / SPA (Angular/React/Vue) targets the agent MUST use
  the **Playwright MCP** browser (render, wait, read the live DOM, click
  client-side routes, watch the network to discover the real REST/GraphQL API,
  prove client-side issues with a screenshot). When no MCP is present, it uses the
  **Playwright CLI** (writes & runs a small `playwright` script / `npx playwright
  screenshot`) to render and capture the app's XHR/fetch traffic — **complementing
  curl**, which only sees the empty shell.
- **Deterministic probe detects SPAs** (`<app-root>`, `ng-version`, near-empty
  body + linked scripts → Angular/React/Vue/SPA) and flags in recon that the
  browser is required — so the SPA agents get selected.
- **+8 SPA/API agents** (library **383**): SPA API & route discovery, hidden-admin /
  client-side access control, login SQLi bypass, SPA DOM XSS, API BOLA via
  sequential IDs, privileged registration / mass assignment, JWT forgery &
  verification bypass, and SPA business-logic abuse — tuned for apps like OWASP
  Juice Shop. (Existing NoSQLi/GraphQL/JWT/mass-assignment agents complement them.)

## Subscription login check & Playwright MCP fixes

- **Subscription login preflight.** Before a `--subscription` run, the harness
  checks that the local CLI (claude/codex/…) is **installed and logged in** and
  prints a clear warning if not — instead of the run silently coming back with
  0 findings. (Not logged in → the CLI returns empty instantly, which was the
  usual cause of "it found nothing / MCP didn't execute".)
- **Playwright MCP now installs the browser.** `ensure_playwright_mcp` also runs
  `npx playwright install chromium` (best-effort; skip with
  `NEUROSPLOIT_SKIP_BROWSER_INSTALL=1`) so the first browser action doesn't
  fail/hang with a missing Chromium.
- **Codex MCP wiring fixed.** Codex takes MCP servers as `-c mcp_servers.*` TOML
  overrides (not a config-file path); the harness now injects our Playwright
  server correctly, so MCP works on Codex too — not just Claude.
- **"No tool activity" diagnostic.** If a subscription+MCP run performs zero
  browser/tool actions, the REPL warns that the CLI likely isn't logged in or the
  MCP didn't start.

## Multi-role auth & access-control testing

- **Named identities in `creds.yaml`** for IDOR / BOLA / BFLA / privilege-escalation
  testing. Define two or more roles and the agent authenticates as each and tests
  **cross-role access** (control vs unauthorized request):
  ```yaml
  admin:
    jwt: eyJ...              # or header:/cookie:/apikey:/login+username+password
  user:
    apikey: abc123          # → X-Api-Key: abc123
  victim:
    cookie: "session=..."
  ```
  Supported per role: `jwt`, `header` (raw), `cookie`, `apikey`, or a
  `login`/`username`/`password` self-login. With ≥2 roles the harness injects an
  access-control directive (capture one role's object IDs/functions, attempt them
  as another role, prove authorized-vs-denied) under the data-safety guardrail.

## Attribution & identification (anti-plagiarism)

- **Identifying User-Agent** on every request — default
  `NeuroSploit/<ver> (authorized security assessment; +github…)`, plus an
  `X-NeuroSploit-Scan` header. Change it with **`/ua <string>`** (REPL) or the
  `NEUROSPLOIT_UA` env var; the run banner shows it.
- **Attribution stamped into every finding** ("Identified and validated by
  NeuroSploit — multi-model adversarial validation …") so provenance travels with
  the finding across the report, `findings.json` and any copy — in the traffic,
  the finding text, and the report footer, so the work can't be silently re-badged.

## Notes

- Additive/back-compatible. Provider count is 14 (Azure OpenAI added in v3.5.2).
  See the README "Cloud credentials" section for a full `creds.yaml` example.

# NeuroSploit v3.5.4 — Release Notes

**Release Date:** July 2026
**Codename:** Robust Attack Chaining & False-Positive Reduction
**License:** MIT
**Credits:** Joas A Santos & Red Team Leaders

---

## TL;DR

v3.5.4 makes NeuroSploit both **deeper** and **more precise**: a real multi-round
**post-exploitation attack-chaining** engine that expands each foothold in new
directions, plus stronger **false-positive** controls so what it reports is
trustworthy.

## Attack chaining (robust, decision-driven)

Replaces the old single-shot chainer with **`attack_chain()`** — an iterative,
per-foothold pivot engine:

- **Per-foothold decisions.** Each round takes the newest confirmed footholds
  (best-first, capped per round) and, for **each one**, an agent decides which
  directions to expand and proves new impact: **post-exploitation** (loot
  creds/keys/config/source), **credential reuse**, **privilege escalation**
  (horizontal & vertical), **lateral movement** to adjacent services/hosts,
  **data exfiltration**, and **new attack surface** the foothold exposes.
- **Loot carried forward.** Credentials/tokens/hosts/endpoints discovered in one
  round are passed to later rounds and reused (agent returns
  `{"findings":[...],"loot":[...]}`), so the engine genuinely pivots in new
  directions instead of re-testing the same spot.
- **No pivoting off false positives.** Each round's new findings are validated
  before they become the next round's footholds.
- **Convergence.** Runs up to `chain_depth` rounds **or** stops when a round finds
  nothing new (loop-until-dry).
- **Control.** New `RunConfig.chain_depth` (default **2**) and a `--chain-depth`
  flag on every engagement command (`0` disables).

## False-positive reduction

- **Robust verdict parsing** (`pool::parse_verdict`) — whitespace-insensitive,
  checks explicit rejection first, counts only explicit confirmations; ambiguous
  replies are *not* counted as confirmed. Replaces the fragile exact-JSON /
  loose-`yes` matching.
- **Severity-aware quorum** (`pool::quorum_confirmed`) — **High/Critical now need
  ≥2 validators AND ≥2/3 agreement** (a single vote can no longer confirm a
  Critical); lower severities need a strict majority. Single-model panels fall
  back to majority so they aren't nuked.
- **Adversarial refute pass** — every confirmed High/Critical is re-examined by a
  skeptical panel that assumes false-positive; findings that can't withstand a
  majority of skeptics are dropped.
- **Stronger validator prompt** with an explicit false-positive checklist
  (reflected-not-executed, version/banner guesses, self-XSS, error-as-injection,
  thin evidence, inflated severity).

## Notes

- Additive and back-compatible; defaults keep behavior sensible if you change
  nothing. Unit tests cover verdict parsing, quorum, and report-hygiene logic.

# NeuroSploit v3.5.3 — Release Notes

**Release Date:** June 2026
**Codename:** Integrations (GitHub · GitLab · Jira)
**License:** MIT
**Credits:** Joas A Santos & Red Team Leaders

---

## TL;DR

v3.5.3 plugs NeuroSploit into your SDLC: review **private** GitHub/GitLab repos
and **Pull Requests**, **watch** a branch and re-review on every commit, and open
a **Jira card per finding** — all toggleable via a new `/integrations` command.

## Highlights

- **GitHub integration**
  - **Private repos**: when enabled, `whitebox` / `greybox --repo` / `tui --repo`
    inject your `GITHUB_TOKEN` into the clone URL (token never printed/stored).
  - **`neurosploit pr <owner/repo> <number>`** — clones the **PR head**
    (`refs/pull/N/head`), runs a white-box review, optionally **posts a summary
    comment** back on the PR (`--comment`) and/or **opens Jira cards** (`--jira`).
  - **`neurosploit watch <owner/repo> --branch <b> --interval <s>`** — polls the
    branch and runs a white-box review **each time a new commit lands**.
- **GitLab integration** — private clone (token-injected) for `whitebox`/`greybox`
  against `gitlab.com` or a self-hosted base.
- **Jira integration** — `--jira` on any engagement (or `pr`/`watch`) opens **one
  card per finding** (summary, severity, CVSS, CWE, location, PoC, evidence,
  remediation) in your project via the Jira REST API.
- **`/integrations` (REPL) + `neurosploit integrations` (CLI)** — `show`,
  `enable`/`disable <github|gitlab|jira>`, and `setup <jira|gitlab|github>`
  (interactive). Config persists to `<project>/.neurosploit/integrations.json`.
  **Secrets are never stored** — only the env-var *name* is saved; values come
  from the environment at use time.
- New harness module `integrations` + app commands `pr` / `watch` /
  `integrations`, plus a `--jira` flag on `run` / `whitebox`.

## Setup

Step-by-step for tokens, scopes and configuration is in
**[TUTORIAL-INTEGRATION.md](TUTORIAL-INTEGRATION.md)** and summarized in the README.

## Notes

- Additive and back-compatible: all existing modes/flags are unchanged; if no
  integration is enabled the behavior is identical to v3.5.2.
- Tokens use env vars: `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `JIRA_EMAIL` +
  `JIRA_API_TOKEN` (names configurable per integration).

# NeuroSploit v3.5.2 — Release Notes

**Release Date:** June 2026
**Codename:** Exploitation Depth & Report Hygiene
**License:** MIT
**Credits:** Joas A Santos & Red Team Leaders

---

## TL;DR

v3.5.2 hard-codes the discipline that separates a great pentest from a noisy
one — distilled from reviewing real AI-pentest output that kept stopping at
*"exposed"* instead of *"exploited"*. The engine now pushes every exposure to
demonstrated impact, **chains** findings, decodes/fingerprints artifacts and
correlates CVEs, audits tokens, and keeps the final report honest (deduplicated
and severity-calibrated).

## Highlights

- **DEPTH doctrine (exploit, don't just expose).** A new doctrine is injected
  into every exploitation prompt (black/grey/chain): any info-disclosure,
  exposed service/catalog/WSDL, leaked credential/token, or reachable dev host
  **must be USED** before it can be a finding — call it, decode it, log in, hit
  the dev host. If it was only observed, it's reported as a **lead**, not a
  confirmed High/Critical.
- **Finding chaining.** Reuse any session/JWT/cookie/credential obtained in one
  step across all other modules; pivot access into IDOR/privesc/exfil and report
  the **chain**, not isolated parts (e.g. captcha-bypass→admin JWT→authenticated
  surface; enum + no-rate-limit→password spraying).
- **Decode & fingerprint → CVE.** Decode opaque tokens/paths (base64/JSON/marshal)
  and pin exact library/gem/plugin/CMS versions, then correlate to known CVEs and
  attempt a safe PoC.
- **Token auditor.** JWT alg-confusion (RS→HS), `alg:none`, kid/jku injection,
  real signature verification, **weak HS256 secret cracking**, and token
  lifecycle (logout/expiry/refresh).
- **Report-hygiene & depth pass (deterministic, in the harness).** After
  validation the run now:
  - **calibrates severity to proven impact** — an unproven High/Critical
    (hedged language, no payload, thin evidence) is capped to Medium and
    re-titled "(potential)";
  - flags **"exposed → exploited" gaps** — exposures on a host with no actual
    exploit get an advisory to go use them;
  - advises **consolidating hygiene** classes (headers/cookies/TLS/HSTS/
    clickjacking/disclosure) repeated across many assets into ONE finding with
    an affected-asset table, instead of inflating the count one-per-host.
- **5 new doctrine meta-agents** (`agents_md/meta/`): `exploit_depth_doctrine`,
  `finding_chainer`, `artifact_decoder`, `token_auditor`, `report_calibrator`
  (meta agents 17 → 22; total library 343 → 348).
- **Source from a GitHub URL.** `whitebox` / `greybox --repo` (and the REPL
  `/repo`) now accept a **git URL** (`https://github.com/owner/repo[.git]`) or an
  `owner/repo` shorthand — the repo is cloned (shallow) into `<base>/repos/` and
  reviewed automatically, no manual `git clone` needed:
  ```bash
  neurosploit whitebox https://github.com/digininja/DVWA \
    --subscription --model anthropic:claude-opus-4-8 -v
  ```
- **Azure OpenAI provider** (resolves #21). OpenAI-compatible: set
  `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` (+ optional `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`, default
  `2024-10-21`) and `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, then `--model azure:<deployment>`
  (the model name is your Azure *deployment* name; auth via the `api-key`
  header).
- **`GOOGLE_API_KEY` alias for Gemini** (resolves #25 confusion). Gemini's API
  path reads `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and now also accepts `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (Google's
  standard env var) when the former is unset. Local providers (ollama/litellm)
  still need **no** key at all.

## Notes

- Pure-additive and back-compatible: existing modes, REPL, TUI, pause/continue,
  crash-recovery and reports are unchanged. The hygiene pass only annotates and
  down-calibrates unproven severities — it never invents or drops findings.
- New unit tests cover the calibration and depth-audit logic
  (`harness::hygiene`).

# NeuroSploit v3.5.1 — Release Notes

**Release Date:** June 2026
**Codename:** Interactive POMDP Harness
**License:** MIT
**Credits:** Joas A Santos & Red Team Leaders

---

## TL;DR

The 3.5.x line turns the Rust harness into a full **interactive REPL** (Claude
Code / Codex / Cursor-CLI style) on top of the multi-model engine: pick models
with arrow-keys, configure API keys per provider, set target/repo/auth/creds and
free-text instructions that steer the agents, then `/run` engagements **in the
background** while you keep typing. v3.5.1 adds a **POMDP belief spine** with
anti-hallucination grounding ("no claim without a tool receipt"), **infra/host**
testing (IP + SSH + Windows/AD) with Linux/Windows/AD agents, **attack-chain
agents**, a **Mission-Control TUI**, structured **Typst** reports, and resilient
run control (live checkpointing, pause-on-quota, instant stop).

## Highlights

- **Interactive REPL** (`neurosploit` with no subcommand): real line editing
  (history ↑/↓, Ctrl-A/E/K, multiline), Tab-completion of `/commands` and
  `@filesystem-paths` (Claude-Code-style file menu), arrow-key model multi-select,
  per-provider API-key config, and a live context bar (`model · cwd · mode▸target`).
- **Engagement modes**: **black-box** (`run`), **white-box** SAST (`whitebox`,
  set `/repo`), **grey-box** (`greybox`, `/repo` + `/target`), **host/infra**
  (`/target <ip>` + `/creds` for SSH / Windows / AD), plus the **TUI** dashboard.
- **POMDP belief state** (`belief.rs`, `pomdp.rs`): a property-graph with
  probabilities + Bayesian update + Shannon-entropy uncertainty, a
  value-of-information planner, and a **grounding gate** (`grounding.rs`,
  `may_assert`) — findings must carry an empirical/symbolic **tool receipt**.
- **Infra / credentials** (`creds.rs`): multi-block YAML (jwt/header/cookie,
  HTTP login, SSH, Windows/AD); real automated login; Linux/Windows/AD agents.
- **Attack-chain agents**: sqli→rce→lpe, ssrf→aws, upload→lfi→rce, and more —
  injected as chain recipes during exploitation.
- **App-stack & CVE hunting**: IIS/.NET (tilde shortname, WebDAV, ViewState),
  CMS (WordPress/Joomla/Drupal), app-server consoles, known-CVE exploitation.
- **13 providers** incl. **LiteLLM** proxy and Gemini/xAI alongside the existing
  OpenAI-compatible set; **subscription mode** drives local agentic CLIs
  (claude/codex/gemini/grok) via stream-json.
- **Mission-Control TUI** (`ratatui`): concurrent activity/findings/targets panels
  with a non-blocking composer active during the run.
- **Structured Typst report**: executive summary, vulnerability-summary table,
  and per-finding sections (criticality, CVSS, OWASP/CWE, PoC, evidence,
  remediation) + an attack-graph / kill-chain mapping (OWASP/CWE/MITRE).
- **Per-project persistence** (`.neurosploit/`, no database): `session.json`,
  `runs.json`, `history.txt` — resumes automatically on reopen.

## Run control (new in 3.5.1)

- **Background `/run`** with a live progress bar, severity-colored findings, and
  the full `file://` report URL on completion/stop.
- **3-way `/stop`**: **[1]** validate findings so far → report · **[2]** raw
  report **now** without validating · **[3]** discard. Raw/discard abort
  in-flight agents immediately (running CLI children are killed via
  `kill_on_drop`); validate soft-stops so the validator still runs.
- **Crash/quit recovery**: every finding is checkpointed live to
  `.neurosploit/active_run.json`; an interrupted run is recovered into `/runs`
  on the next launch, so `/results`, `/finding` and `/report` keep working.
- **Pause-on-exhaustion**: when all models are rate-limited / out of quota the
  run **parks** (state kept) and prints `⏸ token/quota exhausted … PAUSED`.
  Resume with **`/continue`** when your quota renews, or switch with
  **`/model <provider:model>`** (or the `/model` selector) then **`/continue`**.
- **Inspection**: `/results` (live findings), `/finding` (pick one → full
  command + PoC + evidence), `/expand` / Ctrl-O (full untruncated commands),
  `/status`, `/diff`, `/retest`.

## Usage

```bash
cd neurosploit-rs && cargo build --release
./target/release/neurosploit                              # interactive REPL
./target/release/neurosploit run http://target -v --model anthropic:claude-opus-4-8
./target/release/neurosploit whitebox --repo /path/to/code   # white-box SAST
./target/release/neurosploit greybox  --repo /path --target http://target  # grey-box
./target/release/neurosploit run <ip> --creds creds.yaml     # host / infra
./target/release/neurosploit tui http://target --subscription --mcp
```

Cross-platform install (Linux / macOS / Windows, x64 + arm64) via `setup.sh` and
`install.ps1`. See **README.md** and **TUTORIAL.md** for the full walkthrough.

# NeuroSploit v3.4.0 — Release Notes

**Release Date:** June 2026
**Codename:** Rust Multi-Model Harness
**License:** MIT

---

## TL;DR

A new **Rust harness** (`neurosploit-rs/`) re-implements the autonomous runtime
as a single, fast binary built on `tokio` + `axum`. It drives a **pool of LLM
models** with concurrency limits, **provider failover**, and **N-model validator
voting** — multiple models must independently agree a finding is real before it
is reported — then serves its own solid web dashboard. It reuses the existing
`agents_md/` library (213 agents) unchanged.

## Highlights

- **`neurosploit-rs/` cargo workspace**: `harness` lib crate + `neurosploit`
  binary. `cargo build --release` → one static-ish binary.
- **Multi-model pool** (`pool.rs`): bounded concurrency + automatic **failover**
  across providers; the same panel is reused as the **validator voting** jury.
- **Pipeline** (`pipeline.rs`): recon → parallel agent exploitation (semaphore
  bounded) → **N-model adversarial vote** → score → report. Streams live
  progress over a channel.
- **11 providers / 31 models** (`models.rs`), all OpenAI-compatible: Anthropic,
  OpenAI, xAI, NVIDIA NIM, DeepSeek, Mistral, Qwen, Groq, Together, OpenRouter,
  Ollama. Models like **Qwen / DeepSeek / Llama** usable directly.
- **Axum web dashboard** (`app/`): multi-model selection panel, live execution
  console, findings, agent browser, embedded HTML report. Single binary serves
  the SPA — no npm/build.
- **CLI**: `neurosploit serve | run <url> | agents | models`, plus `--offline`
  mode to exercise the full pipeline without any API keys.

## Usage

```bash
cd neurosploit-rs && cargo build --release
./target/release/neurosploit serve                 # → http://127.0.0.1:8788
./target/release/neurosploit run https://t.example \
    --model anthropic:claude-opus-4-8 --model openai:gpt-5.1 --vote-n 3
```

# NeuroSploit v3.3.0 — Release Notes

**Release Date:** June 2026
**Codename:** Autonomous MD-Agent Engine
**License:** MIT

---

## TL;DR

NeuroSploit's pentest agent has been **re-modeled into an autonomous,
markdown-driven engine**. You give it a URL; it composes a master prompt from a
curated library of **213 markdown agents** and drives a locally-installed
**agentic CLI backend** (Claude Code / Codex / Grok CLI, or a Claude
subscription) to run the engagement end-to-end — with **Playwright MCP** for
proof-of-execution and a **reinforcement-learning** loop that adapts agent
selection across runs. The old Python orchestration was retired to `legacy/`.

## Highlights

- **New engine `neurosploit_agent/`** + `./neurosploit` terminal launcher.
  Interactive (`./neurosploit`) or one-shot (`./neurosploit run <url>`).
- **213-agent markdown library (`agents_md/`)**: **196 vulnerability
  specialists** (now covering LLM/AI, cloud/K8s, modern API/auth, advanced
  injection, protocol smuggling, logic/crypto/supply-chain) + **17 meta-agents**.
- **Meta-agents for quality**: `recon`, `exploit_validator`,
  `false_positive_filter`, `severity_assessor`, `impact_evaluator`, `reporter`,
  and `rl_feedback` — the pipeline validates and adversarially refutes every
  candidate before it can become a finding.
- **Pluggable agentic CLI backends** with auto-detection: Claude Code, Codex,
  Grok CLI; **subscription mode** via Claude Code login.
- **Playwright MCP** wired in (`.mcp.json`) so agents prove client-side execution
  (XSS/CSTI) and capture DOM/network/screenshots instead of trusting reflection.
- **Reinforcement learning** (`neurosploit_agent/rl.py` + `meta/rl_feedback.md`):
  bounded per-agent weights with per-tech-stack affinity, persisted to
  `data/rl_state.json`.
- **Latest model registry** (`neurosploit_agent/models.py`): Anthropic Claude
  4.x, OpenAI, xAI Grok, Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama, and **NVIDIA NIM** (PR #28,
  OpenAI-compatible `integrate.api.nvidia.com`, `nvapi-` keys).
- **Data-driven agent builder** `scripts/build_agents.py` for extending the
  library without boilerplate.

## Breaking changes

- The monolithic `neurosploit.py` orchestrator and Python agent classes moved to
  `legacy/` and are no longer the supported entrypoint. Use `./neurosploit`.
- Primary agent library moved from `prompts/agents/` to `agents_md/` (originals
  preserved; meta/role prompts split into `agents_md/meta/`).

## Upgrade notes

1. Install at least one agentic CLI: Claude Code, Codex, or Grok CLI.
2. `npx` (Node) is required for Playwright MCP.
3. Copy `.env.example` → `.env`; set a provider key (or use Claude subscription).
4. `./neurosploit backends` to confirm detection, then `./neurosploit`.

## Core Engine: 100 Vulnerability Types

The vulnerability engine covers 100 distinct vulnerability types organized in 10 categories with dedicated testers, payloads, AI prompts, and proof-of-execution rules for each.

### Categories & Types

| Category | Types | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Injection** | 12 | SQLi (error, union, blind, time-based), Command Injection, SSTI, NoSQL, LDAP, XPath, Expression Language, HTTP Parameter Pollution |
| **XSS** | 3 | Reflected, Stored (two-phase form+display), DOM-based |
| **Authentication** | 7 | Auth Bypass, JWT Manipulation, Session Fixation, Weak Password, Default Credentials, 2FA Bypass, OAuth Misconfig |
| **Authorization** | 5 | IDOR, BOLA, BFLA, Privilege Escalation, Mass Assignment, Forced Browsing |
| **Client-Side** | 9 | CORS, Clickjacking, Open Redirect, DOM Clobbering, PostMessage, WebSocket Hijack, Prototype Pollution, CSS Injection, Tabnabbing |
| **File Access** | 5 | LFI, RFI, Path Traversal, XXE, File Upload |
| **Request Forgery** | 3 | SSRF, SSRF Cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure metadata), CSRF |
| **Infrastructure** | 7 | Security Headers, SSL/TLS, HTTP Methods, Directory Listing, Debug Mode, Exposed Admin, Exposed API Docs, Insecure Cookies |
| **Advanced** | 9 | Race Condition, Business Logic, Rate Limit Bypass, Type Juggling, Timing Attack, Host Header Injection, HTTP Smuggling, Cache Poisoning, CRLF |
| **Data Exposure** | 6 | Sensitive Data, Information Disclosure, API Key Exposure, Source Code Disclosure, Backup Files, Version Disclosure |
| **Cloud & Supply Chain** | 6 | S3 Misconfig, Cloud Metadata, Subdomain Takeover, Vulnerable Dependency, Container Escape, Serverless Misconfig |

### Injection Routing

Every vulnerability type is routed to the correct injection point:

- **Parameter injection** (default): SQLi, XSS, IDOR, SSRF, etc.
- **Header injection**: CRLF, Host Header, HTTP Smuggling
- **Body injection**: XXE
- **Path injection**: Path Traversal, LFI
- **Both (param + path)**: LFI, directory traversal variants

### XSS Pipeline (Reflected)

The reflected XSS engine is a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Canary probe** — unique marker per endpoint+param to detect reflection
2. **Context analysis** — 8 contexts: html_body, attribute_value, script_string, script_block, html_comment, url_context, style_context, event_handler
3. **Filter detection** — batch probe to map allowed/blocked chars, tags, events
4. **AI payload generation** — LLM generates context-aware bypass payloads
5. **Escalation payloads** — WAF/encoding bypass variants
6. **Testing** — up to 30 payloads per param with per-payload dedup
7. **Browser validation** — Playwright popup/cookie/DOM/event verification (optional)

### POST Form Support

- HTML forms detected during recon with method, action, all input fields (including `<select>`, `<textarea>`, hidden fields)
- POST form testing includes **all form fields** (CSRF tokens, hidden inputs) — not just the parameter under test
- Redirect following for POST responses (search forms that redirect to results)
- Full HTTP method support: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD

---

## Autonomous Agent Architecture

### 3-Stream Parallel Auto-Pentest

The agent runs 3 concurrent streams via `asyncio.gather()`:

```
Stream 1: Recon          Stream 2: Junior Tester      Stream 3: Tool Runner
  - Crawl target           - Immediate target test       - Nuclei + Naabu
  - Extract forms           - Consume endpoint queue      - AI-selected tools
  - JS analysis             - 3 payloads/endpoint         - Dynamic install
  - Deep fingerprint        - AI-prioritized types        - Process findings
  - Push to queue           - Skip tested types           - Feed back to recon
        |                         |                             |
        +----------+--------------+-----------------------------+
                   |
            Deep Analysis (50-75%)
            Researcher AI (75%)    ← NEW
            Finalization (75-100%)
```

### Reasoning Engine (ReACT)

AI reasoning at strategic checkpoints (50%, 75%):

- **Think**: analyze situation, available data, findings so far
- **Plan**: recommend next actions, prioritize vuln types
- **Reflect**: evaluate results, adjust strategy

Token budget tracking with graceful degradation:
- 0-60% budget: full AI (reasoning + verification + enhancement)
- 60-80%: reduced (skip enhancement)
- 80-95%: minimal (verification only)
- 95%+: technical only (no AI calls)

### Strategy Adaptation

- **Dead endpoint detection**: skip after 5+ consecutive errors
- **Diminishing returns**: reduce testing on low-yield endpoints
- **Priority recomputation**: re-rank vuln types based on results
- **Pattern propagation**: IDOR on `/users/1` automatically queues `/orders/1`, `/accounts/1`
- **Checkpoint refinement**: at 30%/60%/90% refine attack strategy

### Exploit Chaining

10+ chain rules for multi-step attack paths:

- SSRF -> Internal service access -> Data extraction
- SQLi -> Database-specific escalation (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL)
- XSS -> Session hijacking -> Account takeover
- LFI -> Source code disclosure -> Credential extraction
- Auth bypass -> Privilege escalation -> Admin access

AI-driven chain discovery during finalization phase.

## Validation & Anti-Hallucination Pipeline

### 4-Layer Verification

Every finding passes through 4 independent verification layers before confirmation:

```
Finding Signal
    |
    v
[1] Negative Controls  — Send benign/empty probes. Same response = false positive (-60 penalty)
    |
    v
[2] Proof of Execution — Per-vuln-type proof checks (25+ methods). XSS: context analyzer.
    |                      SSRF: metadata markers. SQLi: DB error patterns. Score 0-60.
    v
[3] AI Interpretation  — LLM analyzes with anti-hallucination system prompt + per-type
    |                      proof requirements. Speculative language rejected.
    v
[4] Confidence Scorer  — Numeric 0-100 score. >=90 confirmed, >=60 likely, <60 rejected.
    |
    v
ValidationJudge (sole authority for finding approval)
```

### Anti-Hallucination System Prompts

12 composable anti-hallucination prompt templates injected into all 17 LLM call sites:

| Prompt | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `anti_hallucination` | Core: never claim vuln without concrete proof |
| `anti_scanner` | Don't behave like a scanner — reason like a pentester |
| `negative_controls` | Explain control test methodology |
| `think_like_pentester` | Manual testing mindset |
| `proof_of_execution` | What constitutes real proof per vuln type |
| `frontend_backend_correlation` | Don't confuse client-side vs server-side |
| `multi_phase_tests` | Two-phase testing (submit + verify) |
| `final_judgment` | Conservative final decision framework |
| `confidence_score` | Numeric scoring calibration |
| `anti_severity_inflation` | Don't inflate severity |
| `operational_humility` | Acknowledge uncertainty |
| `access_control_intelligence` | Data comparison, not status code diff |

100 per-vuln-type proof requirements (e.g., SSRF requires metadata content, not just status diff).

### Cross-Validation

- `_cross_validate_ai_claim()` — independent check for XSS, SQLi, SSRF, IDOR, open redirect, CRLF, XXE, NoSQL
- `_evidence_in_response()` — verify AI claim matches actual HTTP response
- Speculative language rejection ("might be", "could be", "possibly")
- Default `False` — findings rejected unless positively proven

### Access Control Intelligence

- BOLA/BFLA/IDOR use **data comparison** methodology (not status code diff)
- JSON field comparison between authenticated user responses
- Adaptive TP/FP learning across scans (9 patterns, 6 known FP patterns)
- Access control types auto-inject specialized prompts

---

## Kali Sandbox & Tool Execution

### Container-Per-Scan Architecture

Each scan gets its own isolated Kali Linux Docker container:

```
ContainerPool (global coordinator)
    |
    +-- Scan A: KaliSandbox (neurosploit-kali-abc123)
    |       +-- nuclei, naabu, httpx (pre-installed)
    |       +-- wpscan (installed on-demand)
    |       +-- sqlmap (installed on-demand)
    |
    +-- Scan B: KaliSandbox (neurosploit-kali-def456)
    |       +-- nuclei, httpx (pre-installed)
    |       +-- dirsearch (installed on-demand)
    |
    +-- max_concurrent, TTL, orphan cleanup
```

### 55 Security Tools

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Pre-installed (Go) | 11 | nuclei, naabu, httpx, subfinder, katana, dnsx, ffuf, gobuster, dalfox, waybackurls, uncover |
| Pre-installed (APT) | 5 | nmap, nikto, sqlmap, masscan, whatweb |
| Pre-installed (System) | 12 | curl, wget, git, python3, pip3, go, jq, dig, whois, openssl, netcat, bash |
| APT on-demand | 15 | wpscan, dirb, hydra, john, hashcat, sslscan, amass, enum4linux, dnsrecon, fierce, crackmapexec |
| Go on-demand | 4 | gau, gitleaks, anew, httprobe |
| Pip on-demand | 8 | dirsearch, wfuzz, arjun, wafw00f, sslyze, commix, trufflehog, retire |

### Dynamic Tool Engine

- AI selects tools based on detected tech stack
- On-demand install → execute → collect results → cleanup
- Tool output parsed and converted to structured findings
- Results fed back into recon context for deeper testing

### Researcher AI Agent

Hypothesis-driven 0-day discovery agent with Kali sandbox access:

```
Observe (recon data + existing findings)
    |
    v
Hypothesize (AI generates targeted hypotheses)
    |          - Logic flaws, race conditions
    v          - CVE-based attacks, misconfigurations
Plan Tools (AI selects from 55+ tools)
    |
    v
Execute in Sandbox (isolated Kali container)
    |
    v
Analyze Results (AI verdicts: confirmed/rejected)
    |
    v
Loop (max 15 hypotheses, 30 tool executions, 5 iterations)
```

Enabled via: `ENABLE_RESEARCHER_AI=true` + per-scan checkbox in frontend.
