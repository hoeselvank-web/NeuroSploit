//! The uncertainty engine — deciding whether to judge or to go look again.
//!
//! Everything upstream produces a verdict and stops. When the evidence is thin
//! the answer is `needs-review`, which hands a human the same thin evidence and
//! asks them to do the collecting. That is the wrong party: the harness still
//! has the target, the session and the tooling; the reviewer has a paragraph.
//!
//! So before the deterministic validators run, each candidate is scored for how
//! *undecided* it is, and a finding whose uncertainty is high and whose missing
//! evidence is **obtainable** gets one more collection round instead of a
//! verdict.

//! Two rules keep the loop from becoming a treadmill:
//!
//! - **Only obtainable gaps trigger a round.** "No confirmed account exists"
//!   is not something another request fixes; "no baseline was captured" is.
//!   Asking again for what the engagement cannot reach burns budget and changes
//!   nothing.
//! - **Attempts are bounded and recorded.** After the cap the finding is judged
//!   on what exists, with the gap named in its review reason — an honest
//!   `needs-review` that says exactly what was missing beats a silent one.
